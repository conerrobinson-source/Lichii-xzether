# Lichii for Android

An Android port of the [Lichii](https://github.com/zortos293/Eglantine) Nintendo Switch / Switch 2 emulator, maintained by [pavelgajdo](https://github.com/pavelgajdo). It focuses on getting Switch 2 games running on Android phones, starting with Samsung's Exynos phones and their AMD-based Xclipse GPUs.

This is an independent, experimental fork. It is not affiliated with Nintendo or with the upstream projects it builds on.

## Download

- **Releases:** [github.com/pavelgajdo/Lichii-Android/releases](https://github.com/pavelgajdo/Lichii-Android/releases). Download the `.apk` from the latest `android-*` release and install it on your phone. You may need to allow installs from your browser or file manager.
- **Test builds:** the `android-latest` pre-release is rebuilt automatically from every change on `nx2`. It has the newest fixes and the newest bugs.

Requirements: an arm64 phone with Android 13 or newer and Vulkan 1.3. Games, keys and firmware are not included. Only use games and system files you have legally obtained.

## Tested on

| | |
|---|---|
| Phone | Samsung Galaxy S26 (SM-S942B) |
| SoC | Exynos 2600 |
| GPU | Samsung Xclipse 960 (AMD RDNA3, GFX11) |
| RAM | 12 GB |
| OS | Android 17 (One UI) |
| GPU driver | Custom Mesa RADV build for Xclipse ("RADV Xclipse", Mesa 27.0-devel), installed through the app's GPU driver manager |

Samsung's own driver on the S26 is also RADV-based and works, but on this phone it measured about 1.8× slower on the same scene than the custom RADV build.

Other phones may work, but this is the only device the fork is tested on so far.

> 📺 **Game Testing & Video Footage:** Check out gameplay performance tests and video showcases on the [Exynos Gaming YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ExynosGaming-t7k).

## Game status

| Game | Status |
|---|---|
| The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Switch 2) | Playable. Use 0.5x resolution; 16 GB of RAM recommended. |

Only results tested on the phone above are listed here.

### What's different from upstream

- AV1 movies are decoded with Android's hardware decoder (MediaCodec).
- Ocarina of Time's movies skip the game's movie-enhancement neural network (which needs NVIDIA tensor cores), and show the movie frame directly.
- Emulated tensor-core math (HMMA) is about twice as fast on RADV.
- `EDEN_*` diagnostic switches can be set on Android with an `env.txt` file (see below).

## Recommended settings

- **System:** Handheld mode.
- **CPU:** NCE backend.
- **Graphics:** 1× resolution. Install a custom RADV driver if your phone has an Xclipse GPU.

## Reporting problems

[Open an issue](https://github.com/pavelgajdo/Lichii-Android/issues) with:

- your phone model, Android version and GPU driver;
- the game and what happened (screenshots help);
- the log from the affected session: `Android/data/dev.lichii.android/files/log/eden_log.txt` (`dev.lichii.android.relWithDebInfo` for test builds).

Check logs for personal information before uploading. Never upload games, keys, firmware or account data.

### Diagnostic switches

Android can't pass environment variables to an app, so Lichii reads them from `Android/data/<app id>/files/env.txt`, one `KEY=VALUE` per line (`#` starts a comment). They take effect the next time the app starts. The available switches are listed in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#debugging-tools). Leave the file empty for normal play: most switches slow the emulator down.

## Building

```bash
cd src/android
./gradlew assembleMainlineRelWithDebInfo
```

You need the Android SDK, NDK 28.2 and CMake 3.22. The APK is written to `src/android/app/build/outputs/apk/mainline/relWithDebInfo/`. CI builds every push (see [.github/workflows/android.yml](.github/workflows/android.yml)). Pushing a tag named `android-<version>` publishes a release with the APK.
